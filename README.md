Hi Stu!

This sort of resolves your issue but it will only work for one item at a item beacuse the dictionaries are not stored anywhere.

You could create a list of dictionaries and add each item to that list and render the list.

When working with dictionaries it can get tricky trying to figure out what to render as you are dealing with keys and values.

Hope it helps!
